Things to do:

Sign Up authentication:
    Have conditions before utilizing authService, that verify user entry, such as:
        Email length
        Password length (6)
        Username length
    Verify that username does not already exist in database
    Catch the error where an email already exists
    View other errors from firebase documentation to see if any other ones are requried.

Login screen UI fix
    Prevent users from swiping right and exiting the login screen
    Adjust the input keyboard by making it scroll or something of that sort

Animation on index.tsx
    index screen should have animation for the "D-MOBB Gaming" text
    
Audio
    Add audio which plays in the background
    It should continue the song even when screen changes (home -> settings)
    Disable audio feature in settings

Leaderboard
    A popup that shows top players worldwide
    Users can sort the leaderboard by Wins, KO (maybe weekly/monthly as well)
